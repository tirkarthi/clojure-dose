## Clojure

* Alternatives to Pandas in Clojure

@matan asked about pandas like library that helps in processing DataFrames. Apache Arrow seemed to be a good fit but the java libraries are still in pre-alpha stage (v0.9) aiming for binary compatibility before they hit 1.0.0 release

## Beginners

* + cannot be instrumented since it's inlined

@alexmiller : + is inlined and you can’t instrument specs on inlined functions because you don’t go through the var

* reduce on bignum

`(reduce * (range 1 100N))` produces stack overflow

@andy.fingerhut : Also `(range 1 100N)` returns a sequence of longs, not BigInt's.  If you instead use `(range 1N 100)`, it returns a sequence of BigInt's, and then the normal `*` function will preserve them as BigInt's.

@noisesmith and @delaguardo suggested the usage of `*'`

```clojure
user=> (reduce * (range 1N 100))

user=> (reduce *' (range 1 100))

spell-spec is a Clojure/Script library that provides additional spec macros that have the same signature as clojure.spec.alpha/keys macro. spell-spec macros will also verify that unspecified map keys are not misspellings of specified map keys. spell-spec also provides expound integration for nicely formatted results.
