# clojure-dose

 A daily dose of clojure snippets from Clojurians. I am using this repo to collect idioms and interesting discussions that happen in clojurians slack channel while I am learning. Ideally you can select a page and learn some tidbits that were collected for the day.

## Disclaimers

* This is not a replacement to clojuredocs. This only contains some interesting discussions related to clojure in the slack channel.
* I do it out of my free time and interest and hence there is no guarantee that I will continue doing it everyday.
